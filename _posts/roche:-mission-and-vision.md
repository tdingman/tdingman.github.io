Explain game + place in Brown ultimate community

Explain self-PM

Steps: user research, MVP, PVD, user stories, point, sprint
  Much messier than that

Learn Django

Lessons about user research:
	let them talk/don't summarize
	go off script, it's not a survey
	look for feelings

Lessons from user research:
	Mundane vs daring roches
	Goldilocks zone for good roches
	Odds
	Peer pressure
	Producing something from nothing
	Warm fuzzies from memories of great roches

Would have pivoted to Odds for a real product
